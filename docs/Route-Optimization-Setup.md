# Route Optimization System Setup

This document explains how to configure and use the street-level route optimization feature in the TMS dispatch interface.

## Overview
The Route Optimization Service calculates the most efficient routes for **Load + Vehicle** combinations using Google Maps API, with optional driver assignment for maximum operational flexibility.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Core Optimization: Load ‚Üî Vehicle
- **Primary Focus**: Optimize routes based on load requirements and vehicle capabilities
- **Independence**: Route optimization works without driver assignment
- **Flexibility**: Driver assignment is optional and can change during execution

### Driver Assignment: Optional & Flexible
- **Industry Reality**: Drivers have high turnover and shift changes
- **Operational Flexibility**: Routes can be executed by different drivers
- **Future Ready**: Supports autonomous vehicle integration

## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Google Maps API Key

You'll need a Google Maps API key with the following APIs enabled:

1. **Directions API** (Required) - For route calculations
2. **Maps JavaScript API** (Required) - For frontend map display
3. **Places API** (Optional) - For enhanced location search

#### Getting Your API Key:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Enable the required APIs listed above
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
5. Restrict the API key to specific APIs for security
6. Copy your API key

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Backend Configuration:
Update your `server/app/.env` file:
```bash
# Google Maps API Key for route optimization
MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_google_maps_api_key_here
```

#### Frontend Configuration:
Update your `ui/.env` file (copy from `ui/.env.example`):
```bash
# Google Maps API Key for frontend maps
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_google_maps_api_key_here
```

### 3. Docker Environment

The Docker Compose configuration will automatically pick up environment variables from your `.env` files:

- Backend uses `server/app/.env` for `MAPS_API_KEY`  
- Frontend uses `ui/.env` for `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

Simply run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Accessing Route Optimization

1. Open the dispatch map interface
2. Enable the "Routes" filter to show route lines
3. Look for loads with pickup and delivery locations

### 2. Optimizing a Route

**Option A: From Map**
- Find a load with a dashed route line (non-optimized)
- Click the "üó∫Ô∏è Optimize Route" button that appears

**Option B: From Info Window**
- Click on a load marker to open the info window
- Click "üó∫Ô∏è Optimize Route" button in the load details

### 3. Visual Indicators

The map legend shows different route types:

- **Solid thick lines**: Optimized routes with street-level accuracy
- **Dashed thin lines**: Straight-line routes (non-optimized)
- **Green routes**: High optimization scores
- **Yellow/Amber routes**: Moderate optimization scores

### 4. Route Information

Optimized routes display:
- **Distance**: Actual driving distance in miles
- **Duration**: Estimated travel time considering traffic
- **Optimization Score**: Efficiency rating (0-100)
- **Fuel Estimate**: Projected fuel consumption
- **Turn-by-turn directions**: Available via API

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Route Optimization Endpoint
**POST** `/api/routes/optimize-load`

Optimizes a route for a specific load and vehicle combination.

#### Request Body:
```json
{
  "load_id": "uuid",
  "vehicle_id": "uuid", 
  "driver_id": "uuid (optional)",
  "priority": "normal|urgent|eco (optional, default: normal)"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Route optimization completed",
  "route_id": "uuid",
  "distance_miles": 42.3,
  "duration_minutes": 65,
  "optimization_score": 87.5,
  "route_geometry": "LINESTRING(...)"
}
```

### Route Details Endpoint
**GET** `/api/routes/{route_id}`

Returns detailed route information including coordinates and turn-by-turn directions.

#### Response:
```json
{
  "route_id": "uuid",
  "load_number": "L123456",
  "driver_name": "John Smith (optional)",
  "vehicle": "2023 Freightliner Cascadia",
  "distance_miles": 42.3,
  "duration_minutes": 65,
  "optimization_score": 87.5,
  "status": "PLANNED",
  "route_coordinates": [[lat, lng], [lat, lng], ...],
  "fuel_estimate": 8.2,
  "toll_estimate": 15.50
}
```

## üì° Event Schema

### ROUTE_OPTIMIZED Event
Published to Kafka topic `tms.routes` when route optimization completes:

```json
{
  "eventType": "ROUTE_OPTIMIZED",
  "eventVersion": "1.0", 
  "entityType": "ROUTE",
  "entityId": "route-uuid",
  "data": {
    "route_id": "uuid",
    "load_ids": ["uuid"],
    "vehicle_id": "uuid",
    "driver_id": "uuid (optional)",
    "original_distance": 45.2,
    "optimized_distance": 42.3,
    "time_saved": 8.5,
    "fuel_saved": 1.2,
    "algorithm_used": "google_maps_api",
    "optimization_score": 87.5,
    "traffic_considered": true,
    "steps_count": 12,
    "encoded_polyline": "google_maps_encoded_polyline_string"
  }
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Routes Table Structure
The routes table supports our flexible driver assignment architecture:

```sql
CREATE TABLE routes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    load_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES loads(id),
    driver_id UUID REFERENCES drivers(id),  -- NULLABLE for flexibility
    vehicle_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES vehicles(id),
    origin_location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326),
    destination_location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326),
    route_geometry GEOMETRY(LINESTRING, 4326),  -- PostGIS route coordinates
    planned_distance_miles DECIMAL(10,2),
    planned_duration_minutes INTEGER,
    optimization_score DECIMAL(5,2),
    fuel_estimate DECIMAL(8,2),
    toll_estimate DECIMAL(8,2),
    status route_status_enum DEFAULT 'PLANNED',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Design Decisions:
- **driver_id is NULLABLE**: Routes can exist without driver assignment
- **PostGIS LINESTRING**: Stores actual route coordinates for map display
- **route_status_enum**: PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- **optimization_score**: 0-100 rating of route efficiency

## üîî Real-Time Events

The system publishes `ROUTE_OPTIMIZED` events when routes are calculated:

```json
{
  "event_type": "ROUTE_OPTIMIZED",
  "route_id": "uuid",
  "load_id": "uuid", 
  "vehicle_id": "uuid",
  "driver_id": "uuid",  # May be null
  "optimization_data": {
    "distance_miles": 162.35,
    "duration_minutes": 152,
    "fuel_saved": 3.2,
    "time_saved": 18,
    "algorithm_used": "google_maps_directions"
  }
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Google Maps API quota exceeded**
   - Check your API usage in Google Cloud Console
   - Consider implementing rate limiting
   - Monitor daily quotas and billing

2. **Route optimization returns straight-line routes**
   - Verify MAPS_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Check API key has Directions API enabled
   - Review API key restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)

3. **Database errors with route geometry**
   - Ensure PostGIS extension is installed
   - Verify TimescaleDB image includes PostGIS (`timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16`)

4. **Event publishing fails**
   - Check Kafka connectivity
   - Verify event schema matches PRD Events Schema
   - Monitor Kafka topic `tms.routes` for messages

### API Key Security:

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all deployments
- Restrict API keys to specific APIs and domains
- Monitor API usage in Google Cloud Console

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Route Planning**: Optimize routes during load assignment for best results
2. **Batch Operations**: Consider optimizing multiple routes simultaneously
3. **Traffic Timing**: Routes calculated during peak hours include traffic delays
4. **Monitoring**: Track optimization scores to measure system efficiency
5. **Fallbacks**: System gracefully falls back to straight-line routes if Google Maps is unavailable

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

- **Multi-stop optimization**: Optimize routes with multiple waypoints
- **Driver preferences**: Consider driver-specific routing preferences
- **Vehicle constraints**: Factor in vehicle size/weight restrictions
- **Cost optimization**: Balance distance vs. fuel costs vs. tolls
- **Historical analysis**: Learn from past route performance
