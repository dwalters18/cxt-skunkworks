## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
The TMS API serves as the definitive contract for all external and internal API interactions within the Transportation Management System. This RESTful API implements event-driven architecture with real-time capabilities, leveraging polyglot persistence across PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Neo4j databases [1,3,4]. The API provides comprehensive functionality for load management, vehicle tracking, driver management, route optimization, and real-time analytics [1,2,3].

### 1.2 Core Architectural Principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Complete system transparency through comprehensive event streaming [1,5]
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Optimal database selection for specialized use cases [1,4,6]  
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket integration for live operational updates [1,3,5]
- **Strict Data Validation**: Pydantic V2 compliance with comprehensive validation [3]
- **Spatial Data Processing**: PostGIS integration for geographic operations [3,4]
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into domain-specific routers for maintainability and scalability [3]

### 1.3 API Scope
This specification covers all TMS API endpoints including Load Management, Vehicle Management, Driver Management, Route Optimization, Event Management, Analytics, and WebSocket real-time communication [3]. The API serves as the primary interface for the dispatching interface and external system integrations [2,3].

### 1.4 API Architecture
The TMS API is organized into modular, domain-specific routers:
- **Health Router** (`/health`): System health and status monitoring
- **Loads Router** (`/api/loads`): Load management and lifecycle operations
- **Drivers Router** (`/api/drivers`): Driver management and assignment workflows
- **Vehicles Router** (`/api/vehicles`): Vehicle tracking and management
- **Routes Router** (`/api/routes`): Route optimization and management
- **Events Router** (`/events`): Event management and streaming
- **Analytics Router** (`/analytics`): Dashboard and performance analytics
- **WebSocket Router** (`/ws`): Real-time communication endpoints

## 2. Core API Principles

### 2.1 RESTful Architecture
The TMS API follows RESTful design principles with consistent HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming conventions [3]. All endpoints use standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with appropriate status codes for success and error scenarios [3].

### 2.2 Event-Driven Nature
Every API operation that modifies system state publishes corresponding events to Kafka topics, enabling real-time system transparency and decoupled service communication [3,5]. Events are published across specialized topics including `tms.loads`, `tms.vehicles`, `tms.drivers`, `tms.routes`, and `tms.system.alerts` [5].

### 2.3 Real-Time Capabilities
WebSocket endpoints provide real-time communication for live operational updates, leveraging Kafka event streams to push immediate notifications to connected clients [3,5]. This enables responsive dispatching interfaces and proactive exception handling [2,3].

### 2.4 Data Validation Standards
All API endpoints implement strict data validation using Pydantic V2 models with comprehensive validation rules [3]:
- **UUID Pattern Validation**: All entity identifiers use UUID format with Pydantic V2-compatible validation [3]
- **Google Maps API Compatibility**: Spatial data validates against Google Maps API coordinate ranges [3]
- **Financial Precision**: Monetary values use Decimal types for accurate calculations [3]
- **Enum Standards**: All enum values follow SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE convention [3]

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### 3.1 Current Status
The current API implementation focuses on core functionality with basic security measures including input validation, CORS configuration, SQL injection prevention, and error message sanitization [3]. 

### 3.2 Planned Implementation
Future authentication and authorization will include [3]:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Dispatcher, administrator, and read-only user roles
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integration with enterprise authentication systems
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation for external integrations
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Stateless authentication for scalable operations
